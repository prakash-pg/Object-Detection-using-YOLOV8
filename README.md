# Object-Detection-using-YOLOV8

The objective of this project is to leverage pre-trained COCO datasets and implement the YOLOv8
algorithm with the OpenCV deep learning framework to acheive faster and more accurate object
detection and recognition in images, videos, and webcams. The project will focus on optimizing the
algorithm parameters, data quality, and hardware setup to ensure the best possible performance
